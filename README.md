`.gitignore`-aware listing.

## Features

- **Interactive grid view** — every directory is a single layer of clickable
  cards. No deep tree to scan with your eyes.
- **Real mouse support** — click any folder to enter it, click `..` to go up.
- **Keyboard-first** — arrow keys or `wasd`, `Enter` to open, `Backspace` /
  `Esc` to go up, `q` to quit.
- **Gitignore-aware** — files matched by your project's `.gitignore` are
  hidden by default, just like in your editor. Pass `--no-ignore` to see
  everything.
- **Pipe-friendly** — when stdout is not a terminal (or you pass `--list`),
  output is a clean, plain listing you can pipe into `grep`, `xargs`, etc.
- **Zero runtime config** — single binary, no shell integration required.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```sh
brew install mondial7/tap/mira
```

The tap is published automatically on every release, so `brew upgrade
mira` always pulls the latest.

### Pre-built binaries

Download the binary for your platform from the
[latest release](https://github.com/mondial7/mira/releases/latest)
and put it on your `PATH`. Each release includes SHA-256 checksums and an
SBOM.

### From source

```sh
go install github.com/mondial7/mira@latest
```

## Usage

```text
Usage: mira [options] [path]

Options:
  -a              show hidden (dotfile) entries
  -d              list directories only
  --list          force flat-list output instead of the TUI
  --no-ignore     disable .gitignore filtering
  --cd-file PATH  on 'e' (end here), write the chosen directory to PATH
                  (used by the shell wrapper — see below)
  --version       print version and exit
```

### Examples

Browse the current directory interactively:

```sh
mira
```

Browse a specific path, including hidden files and gitignored entries:

```sh
mira -a --no-ignore ~/code/some-repo
```

Pipe a flat listing into your shell:

```sh
mira --list | grep .go
```

| `q` / `Ctrl-C`            | Quit                                          |
| `e`                       | End here — quit and `cd` into the directory † |
| Mouse click on a folder   | Enter that folder                             |
| Mouse click on `..`       | Go up                                         |

† Requires the shell wrapper from the next section.

When the find bar is open: type to filter (case-insensitive subsequence
match), arrow keys to move within matches, `Enter` to open the
highlighted folder, `Esc` to cancel and restore the full listing.

### Settings

Press `.` in the file browser to open the settings overlay. It exposes
three knobs that change the look without leaving the TUI:

| Setting   | Values                          | Default |
| --------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| Theme     | `slate`, `forest`, `ocean`, `rose` | `slate` |
| Borders   | `fine`, `thick`, `dotted`       | `fine`  |
| Bionic    | `on`, `off`                     | `on`    |

Inside the overlay, `↑`/`↓` (or `j`/`k`) moves between rows, `←`/`→`
(or `h`/`l`) cycles the focused value, `Enter` cycles forward, and
`Esc` or `.` closes the overlay. Settings live for the session; a
persisted-config story will land alongside the rest of the v1
customisation surface.

### End here & cd: shell wrapper

> **Status:** the original capital-`Q` binding was renamed to `e`
> ("end here") on the road to v1, alongside a rework of the cd handoff
> that fixes a v0.1 bug where some shells/terminals didn't follow the
> chosen directory. Plain `q` (lowercase) quits without changing
> directory and is unaffected.

`e` only changes the parent shell's directory if you wrap the binary in
a shell function. The wrapper passes a temp file via `--cd-file` and
reads it back after the TUI exits — this is bulletproof against any
output that the terminal-restore step might emit.

Drop one of these in your shell rc file (rename `m` to whatever you like):

```sh
# ~/.bashrc / ~/.zshrc
m() {
  local f
  f=$(mktemp -t mira.XXXXXX) || return
  command mira --cd-file "$f" "$@"
  if [ -s "$f" ]; then
    cd -- "$(cat "$f")"
  fi
  rm -f "$f"
}
```

```fish
# ~/.config/fish/functions/m.fish
function m
  set f (mktemp -t mira.XXXXXX); or return
  command mira --cd-file $f $argv
  if test -s $f
    cd -- (cat $f)
  end
  rm -f $f
end
```

Now `m` opens the TUI; press `e` to end the session and have your shell
follow you into whatever directory you ended up exploring. Plain `q`
exits without changing the directory.

## Roadmap to v1.0

`v0.1` is the first public release — usable end-to-end, but a few items
are explicitly deferred until **v1.0**:

- **Verify `e` end-here cd handoff in the wild.** The v0.1 `Q` binding
  was retired in favour of `e` together with a rewrite of the cd
  handoff (see shell-wrapper section above); the rewrite needs more
  shell/terminal coverage before v1 ships.
- **Persisted settings.** The `.` overlay (theme · borders · bionic)
  ships in this release, but choices reset on every launch. A
  config-file backing for the same overlay — plus the keymap and
  default-flag surfaces that will follow the same pattern — is the
  remaining v1 piece.
Smaller polish items are tracked in
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/mondial7/mira/issues).
